TwitShop
========

A shopping application based on twitter data stream. 
Done as part of Information Retrieval course. 

You need to have a resources/input.txt file that contains the list of user ids whose data you want to crawl.
Generate your own oauth from Twitter and store them in twitteroauth.properties.
Have an output folder for the crawled data. 

Feel free to use code in your projects. I would be glad if you provided recognition. :)
